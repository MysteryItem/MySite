          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>A curious individual decided to try coding, not knowing how it would change my life. I started with simple projects and soon became enthralled by the limitless possibilities of programming. As I delved deeper into the world of coding, I found myself constantly challenged and inspired. Before long, I was staying up late, eager to bring my latest ideas to life. Coding had become an addiction, and I was hooked. I knew I had found my true calling, and I couldn't wait to see where my passion for programming would take me next.</p>

          <h3>Big Rock Challenge</h3>
          <p>I am a climber, who had been practicing for months to climb a particularly difficult route. On the day of the climb, I approached the boulder with determination. With each move, I pushed myself to the limit, feeling my muscles strain and my heart pound. Finally, I reached the top, triumphant. The feeling of accomplishment and exhilaration was unlike anything I had ever experienced. I knew from that moment on, I was hooked on bouldering and the thrill of the climb.</p>
